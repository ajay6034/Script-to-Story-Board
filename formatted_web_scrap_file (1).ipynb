A small excavated room illuminated by work lights. Lodged up against the walls and across the ceiling are wooden beams. In between each beam are varying stages of an elaborate process of insulation and sound proofing that consists of a thick layer of newspaper as a base and then blankets and pillows squeezed in on top. There is a hay bale up against one wall and a mattress leaned up against another.  In the middle of the room, MARCUS walks past... EVELYN, who is bent over behind an odd wooden box. Suddenly she stands up, holding a beautiful and delicate... baby mobile.  As she turns and reaches the mobile high in the air to a beam above her we get a clear shot... of her protruding belly.   Even a layman guess would put her over 8 months. EVELYN gently taps the mobile as we:  ARE NOW CLOSE ON the small ducks and clouds moving through the air, EVELYN below looking up... with a smile.  MARCUS sits down next to REGAN who is on the floor next to a stack of old newspapers and bottles of glue.  She removes a large sheet of newspaper from a plastic tray of glue, lets it drip... and then applies it to the wall with a thick paintbrush. As she moves the paintbrush vertically down the dripping white, a piece of an image can be seen... It is a bra ad. REGAN slowly looks over to MARCUS... who stares at it.  BACK ON EVELYN as she removes the top of the odd wooden box. WE FOLLOW her hands in to reveal... a heavily quilted inside with adorable baby blankets, a small teddy bear... and a clear plastic air mask??  EVELYN's fingers fumble with something in the corner until she finally threads through... a thin plastic tube... and connects it to the air mask. It looks similar to an emergency breathing apparatus one might see in an ambulance or hospital... because it is.  BACK ON MARCUS, as he now removes a large piece of dripping newspaper out of the tray and places it on the wall. Like his sister, he swipes his thick paintbrush vertically down the dripping white, this time partially revealing a front page headline. It reads...  `AGE OF MASS' MARCUS looks at it inquisitively... and then swipes the paintbrush horizontally across the whole headline.  It reads:  `IMAGE OF MASSACRED MILITARY SHOCKS THE WORLD' MARCUS freezes... then looks below to see the top of a grainy newspaper photograph. All we can make out is... a twisted human arm. His hand slowly begins to shake as he raises the paintbrush to reveal the rest of the image... when suddenly:  A PILLOW FLIES INTO FRAME!!!!!!  MARCUS JUMPS!!!!!... Only to see his mom holding a pillow over the newspaper with a knowing look. After a beat, she hands MARCUS a long piece of tape to secure the pillow to the wall.\",\n          \"FROM INSIDE THE SHATTERED PANE, we now follow the PVC pipe into... an old washing machine... now filled with rain water.  Suddenly... a piece of clothing slowly comes into frame and silently descends into the water.  WE WIDEN OUT TO SEE EVELYN places more clothes into a WASHER... that is unplugged. We see that she is simply using the corrugated tumbler inside as a wash board.  She removes a large plaid shirt just above the water line (still inside the tumbler) and squeezes it dry. The action is virtually inaudible.  CLOSE UP on a small pile of clothes being stacked onto other clothes. Then a CINCH.  EVELYN stands up over the newly packed cloth laundry bag... then bends backward, attempting to relieve a pain in her back. When she's done, she picks up the full laundry bag with one hand... and another full laundry bag with the other.  EVELYN struggles to the foot of the stairs with the two bags and puts them down. She then takes a deep breath looks up the stairwell and begins to ascend... again carefully placing her feet on specific spots on each step. Holding one bag as high as she can and dragging the second behind her... It's uncomfortable watching a fully pregnant woman traverse in this manner.  WE GO CLOSE ON several stairs as EVELYN'S feet step up... and drag the bag up the first step... then the second.   Her feet disappear. As she drags the bag up onto the third... IT CATCHES ON A BENT NAIL IN THE STAIR!!  ON EVELYN, not seeing the cause, pulls again... AND BEGINS TO FALL!!!!!!  She catches herself on the wall, her eyes lit up... breathing heavily... she's ok!  She quietly picks up the bags again and pulls once more.  CLOSE UP ON: THE TIP OF A NAIL IN THE STEP LIFTING OFF THE STEP, ALMOST STRAIGHT UP... AND THEN RELEASING THE BAG.  ON EVELYN, satisfied, as she drags the bags to the top of the stairs and disappears.  WE RACK FOCUS to reveal, in the foreground...  THE NAIL STANDING STRAIGHT UP!!!\",\n          \"CLOSE ON REGAN... as she is placed down onto the sand path.  A HAND COVERS HER MOUTH!  AS REGAN spins around we see... LEE kneeling in front of her.  LEE (SIGNING) You CANNOT go down there!  REGAN (SIGNING) WHY NOT???  LEE (SIGNING) You know why.  REGAN (SIGNING) I won't make a sound!!! I'm not a child!!!  LEE pauses... that line stings.  LEE (SIGNING) Just... don't.  The two stare into each other's eyes communicating more than any sign language could.  Suddenly... LEE reaches up to her face?... His still dirty hands push the hair back over her right ear? It seems so uncharacteristically warm and gentle when suddenly...  LEE reaches into his pocket with his right hand and pulls out... THE HEARING AID from the night before.  LEE (SIGNING) (CONT'D) This time, I was able to use small amplifiers from the stereo speaker to--   REGAN (SIGNING) It won't work.  LEE (SIGNING) No, our problem has always been power, but this should increase the frequency to--  REGAN (SIGNING) It never works!!  LEE (SIGNING) ... But we'll keep trying til it does.  REGAN looks up at him blankly... as LEE reaches to bring the new hearing aid up to her ear when suddenly...  REGAN pushes his hand away.  LEE reaches up to her ear to try again... REGAN pushes his hand away again, giving him a cold stare. With so much history behind it... It's a bizarrely heartbreaking altercation.  He tries again... she pushes again... even harder.  LEE looks at his daughter as she looks at him... her venomous face, betrayed by the large tears that roll down her cheek.  After a long moment... REGAN snatches the hearing aid from her father's hand and walks away.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
