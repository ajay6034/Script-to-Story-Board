# Script-to-Story-Board
Capstone Project For the Course DSCI 6051(Data Science Capstone Project)
Storyboards are a ubiquitous part of the creation process for various forms of media. Films and video games utilize storyboards during the early stages of their creation. In this stage of production people have the opportunity to drastically edit the proposed scene fairly easily. However, any changes made to a storyboard require an artist to redraw/edit the storyboard panels accordingly. As such, even storyboards that are intended to be a temporary, quick, and rough creation can consume resources that could otherwise be applied towards creating the actual product. In this project, NLP techniques will be used to automatize processing of movie scripts to extract and project elements associated with their respective storyboards.
# Deliverables Of the Project
The deliverables typically include a set of visual representations that convey the key elements of the script:
1.	Extracting important concepts (elements) from the script.
2.	From the Extracted Elements Creating Story Board Images.
3.	Character Designs and visual representations for each major character in the Script File.
